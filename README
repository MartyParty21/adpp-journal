Decentralized Multi-robot Planning
==================================

Compiling
---------
The dependencies are managed using Maven. To compile the project and create a jar archive with dependencies run:	

$ mvn package

The jar archive with all dependencies will be in:

target/admap-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Alternatively, you can open the project in your favorite IDE, i.e. in Eclipse.

Getting started
---------------

The planners are run through cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator class. 

For example the following command will run the ADRPP on the problem instance 
described in file problems/ubremen-r27.xml.

java -jar target/admap-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator -problemfile problems/ubremen-r27.xml -method ADRPP -maxtime 15000 -timestep 45 -summary -showvis

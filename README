README
======

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms PP, RPP, SDPP, SDRPP, ADPP, and ADRPP described in the article 

M. Čáp, P. Novák, A. Kleiner, and M. Selecký, “Prioritized planning algorithms for trajectory coordination of multiple mobile robots,” IEEE transactions on automation science and engineering, 2015.

Further, it contains the dataset and script neccessary to reproduce the experimental results reported in the article.

Running the experiments
-----------------------

The following software must be installed on the machine where the experiment is executed: 
 * Java JDK 7 or higher
 * Maven
 * GNU parallel
 * R programming language with packages: plyr, ggplot2 rcolorbrewer, gridExtra

In Ubuntu 14.04, all the dependencies can be installed by running

$ sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jdk maven parallel r-base r-cran-plyr r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-rcolorbrewer
$ sudo Rscript -e "install.packages('gridExtra', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')"

Then, the entire experiment can be recomputed by running the run-experiment script:

$ ./run-experiment.sh 


Inspect the source code
-----------------------
The source code of all solvers used in the experiment is in admap-solver folder. Consult admap-solver/README for details.

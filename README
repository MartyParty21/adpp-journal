==============================

**Name:** Experimental validation of distributed algorithms

**Supervisor:** doc. Ing. Jiří Vokřínek, Ph.D. (jiri.vokrinek@fel.cvut.cz)
**Department of supervisor:** Department of Computer Science

About
------
This repository includes a customized fork of the ADPP project. The project was integrated to a platform for running distributed algorithms as a part of a bachelor thesis, and is only used as a submodule in the overal project
This project can still be started as originally implemented, however, in order to start it as a distributed algorithm of the above-mentioned platform, follow the manual in the [parent project](https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/rokytmar/bachelor-thesis)

The original content of README follows


README
======

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms PP, RPP, SDPP, SDRPP, ADPP, and ADRPP described in the article 

M. Čáp, P. Novák, A. Kleiner, and M. Selecký, “Prioritized planning algorithms for trajectory coordination of multiple mobile robots,” IEEE transactions on automation science and engineering, 2015.

Further, it contains the dataset and script neccessary to reproduce the experimental results reported in the article.

Running the experiments
-----------------------

The following software must be installed on the machine where the experiment is executed: 
 * Java JDK 7 or higher
 * Maven
 * GNU parallel
 * R programming language with packages: plyr, ggplot2, rcolorbrewer, gridExtra

In Ubuntu 14.04, all the dependencies can be installed by running

$ sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jdk maven parallel r-base r-cran-plyr r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-rcolorbrewer
$ sudo Rscript -e "install.packages('gridExtra', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')"

Then, the entire experiment can be recomputed by running the run-experiment script:

$ ./run-experiment.sh 

When the script finishes (which may take many hours), the plots summarizing the results of the experiment will be generated in /plots directory. 


Inspect the source code
-----------------------
The source code of all solvers used in the experiment is in admap-solver folder. Consult admap-solver/README for details.

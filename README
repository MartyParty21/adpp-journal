How to run an experiment
========================

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms PP, RPP, SDPP, SDRPP, ADPP, and ADRPP as described in the article 

M. Čáp, P. Novák, A. Kleiner, and M. Selecký, “Prioritized planning algorithms for trajectory coordination of multiple mobile robots,” IEEE transactions on automation science and engineering (in review), 2014

and the datasets used for their comparison. This document describes how to recompute the experiments from the paper.

1) Run the experiments
----------------------

The following command 

$ ./run.sh INSTANCESET NCPU

executes the experimental comparison on instanceset INSTANCESET using NCPU cpus (i.e. this parameter specifies how many simulation will be run in parallel).

To run all experiments on one core, run the following commands:

$ ./run.sh empty-hall-r22 1
$ ./run.sh empty-hall-r22-docks 1
$ ./run.sh ubremen-r27 1
$ ./run.sh ubremen-r27-docks 1
$ ./run.sh warehouse-r25 1
$ ./run.sh warehouse-r25-docks 1

2) Process the data
-------------------

The experiment results for the instanceset INSTANCESET will stored be in the csv file named instances/INSTANCESET/data.out.head. 
The results are processed using an R-script in process.r. Edit the name of the instance set at the beginning of the script and run the script. The resulting plots will be generated in instances/plots folder. 

3) Inspect the source code
--------------------------

The source code of all solvers used in the experiment is in admap-solver folder. Consult admap-solver/README for details.
